# TitanicAnalysis


Quick analysis that I did with the Titanic dataset, mainly to practice my pandas / python skills and also to put some machine learning skills that I learned in the past few weeks about predicting either someone survived or not with supervisioned learning.

My analysis is in raw.ipynb file and the predictions is in titanic_prediction.ipynb file
